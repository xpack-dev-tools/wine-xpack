### Check the latest upstream release

The latest releases must have been announced in
WineHQ [News](https://www.winehq.org/news/) and
[downloads](https://dl.winehq.org/wine/source/); the stable
releases are in the `.0` folders (like {versionMajor()}.0).

Compare the latest upstream release with the latest xPack
[release](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/wine-xpack/releases).
If necessary, update the triplet, otherwise increase the fourth number,
as below.
